<p>Periodontal procedures are available to lay the groundwork for restorative and cosmetic dentistry and/or to improve the esthetics of your gum line.</p>
<p>You may have asked your periodontist about procedures to improve a "gummy" smile because your teeth appear short. Your teeth may actually be the proper lengths, but they're covered with too much gum tissue.  To correct this, your periodontist performs crown lengthening.</p>

<p>During this procedure, excess gum and bone tissue is reshaped to expose more of the natural tooth.  This can be done to one tooth, to even your gum line, or to several teeth to expose a natural, broad smile.</p>
<p>Your dentist or periodontist may also recommend crown lengthening to make a restorative or cosmetic dental procedure possible.  Perhaps your tooth is decayed, broken below the gum line, or has insufficient tooth structure for a restoration, such as a crown or bridge.  Crown lengthening adjusts the gum and bone level to expose more of the tooth so it can be restored.</p>

<p><b>What are the benefits of this procedure?</b></p>
<p>Whether you have crown lengthening to improve function or esthetics, patients often receive the benefits of both: a beautiful new smile and improved periodontal health &mdash; your keys to smiling, eating and speaking with comfort and confidence.</p>
