<p>Use floss that is 18 inches
long. Wind most of the floss
around your middle finger and
the remainder around a middle
finger of the opposite hand.
Gently insert the floss between
the teeth using a back-and-forth
motion, guiding the floss with
your forefingers. Guide the floss
to the gumline and curve the
floss into a C-shape. Slide it into
the space between the gum and
tooth until you feel light resistance.
Repeat this process between
every tooth and don’t forget
the back sides of your back
teeth.
<p>Begin brushing your teeth by
cleaning all outside surfaces with
your toothbrush at a 45-degree
angle where your gums and teeth
meet. Gently move the brush in
a circular motion several times.
Apply light pressure to get the
bristles between the teeth. Use
this same method on the inside
of the back teeth. When cleaning
the inside surfaces of the
upper and lower front teeth, hold
the brush vertically. Make several
gentle back-and-forth
strokes over each tooth and its
surrounding gum tissue. To clean
the biting surfaces, use short
gentle strokes. Do not forget to
brush your tongue.
