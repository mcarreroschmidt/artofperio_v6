<p>You may be missing one or more teeth as a result of periodontal disease or trauma. Perhaps that adult tooth may never have come in.  You know that your confidence about your teeth affects how you feel about yourself, both personally and professionally. Perhaps you hide your smile because of spaces from missing teeth. Maybe your dentures don't feel secure. Perhaps you have difficulty chewing. If you are missing one or more teeth and would like to smile, speak and eat again with comfort and confidence, there is good news! Dental implants are teeth that can look and feel just like your own! Under proper conditions, such as placement by Dr. Goteiner and diligent patient maintenance, implants can last a lifetime.
