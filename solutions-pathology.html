<p>Dr. Goteiner’s fellowship also included training in oral medicine.  Presently he is the oral medicine advisor for the Morris Study Club and holds a dual appointment at the University of Medicine and dentistry of New Jersey (One in the Department of Periodontics and the other in the Division of Oral Medicine in the Department of Oral Biology).
<p>The inside of the mouth is normally lined with a special type of skin (mucosa) that is smooth and coral pink in color. In addition, each tooth is surrounded by a collar of tissue containing a specific fluid. Any alteration of the tissue appearance or fluid chemistry could be a warning sign for a pathological process. Dr. Goteiner uses the latest diagnostic tools such as DNA probe, microbiological testing, brush biopsy and immunofluorescence to identify the infection and the disease process. Such information provides relevant information on the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the pathogens and diagnose disease that on occasion appear first in the mouth.
<p>The most serious threat to our patients is oral cancer.
<p>The following can be signs of the beginning of a pathologic process or cancerous growth:
<ul>
<li>Reddish patches (erythroplasia) or whitish patches (leukoplakia) in the mouth
<li>A sore that fails to heal and bleeds easily
<li>A lump or thickening on the skin lining the inside of the mouth
<li>Chronic sore throat or hoarseness
<li>Difficulty in chewing or swallowing
</ul>
<p>These changes can be detected on the lips, cheeks, palate, gum tissue around the teeth, tongue, face, and/or neck. Pain is not always necessary to define a pathology. In order to properly diagnose these conditions, a thorough medical history must be taken, including a review of all of your medications.
<p>Following a complete examination, certain laboratory tests may be required as well as a small tissue biopsy, which can be examined under a microscope. Since many of these diseases look similar clinically, the biopsy is often the most critical factor in a proper diagnosis.
