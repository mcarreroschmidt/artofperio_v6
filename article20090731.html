<span>WASHINGTON TWP. &ndash; William Reynolds of Long Valley and Ryan Shirtz of Mendham are teenagers who care and a Chester dentist wants the community to know about them.<br><br>
The Chester dentist, David Goteiner,&nbsp; said Reynolds and Shirtz are among a group of young people who &ldquo;make America America.&rdquo;<br><br>
That is why Goteiner and his wife, Carrie, have been giving community service awards to area teenagers since 1985. The Goteiners have annually provided $200 Savings Bonds to recognize students&rsquo; volunteer work from West Morris Central, Mendham,&nbsp; Roxbury, Mount Olive, Hackettstown and Randolph high schools.<br><br>
Reynolds, a student at West Morris Central High School, and Shirtz, a student at Mendham High School, are among this year&rsquo;s six recipients.</span><br><br>

<span>&ldquo;The award is much more than money,&rdquo; Goteiner said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really about recognition.&rdquo;<br><br>
The dentist said that each year, he sends a notice of the award to high school officials, who then organize a committee and nominate a deserving student.<br><br>
The award criteria are simple: The winner should be someone who does not seek recognition, who demonstrates high standards of honesty and responsibility, and exemplifies &ldquo;the citizen who cares for and contributes to his or her community through action.&rdquo;<br><br>
After they are chosen, the winners, who are not informed of their nomination, are recognized at their high school&rsquo;s end-of-the-year awards ceremony with a certificate and the bond.<br><br>
Goteiner said he wanted to help dispel the stereotype of teenagers as indifferent or uninvolved.<br><br>
&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re trying to do is shed a little light on teenagers who really care,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;<br><br>
Reynolds, 18, is a cadet-level emergency medical technician in Long Valley and has responded to more than 200 calls, a feat that earned him &ldquo;Rookie of the Year&rdquo; from his first aid squad.<br><br>
He also completed his Eagle Scout project last October, recording the location of veterans&rsquo; graves in a local cemetery. The findings were later presented to the American Legion Post, which will file the information with area libraries, according to<br><br>
Lori Gleason, Reynolds&rsquo; guidance counselor at West Morris Central High School, who submitted a letter nominating Reynolds for the award.<br><br>
In September, Reynolds will be a student at Worcester (Mass.) State College where he plans to major in nursing and concentrate in emergency medicine.<br><br>
Shirtz, also 18, was one of three presidents of Mendham High School&rsquo;s Service Club. The&nbsp; club advisor, Jennifer Brown, said Shirtz has been extremely involved in and &ldquo;a vital part&rdquo; of the group.<br><br>
Shirtz said he helped with a canned food and Christmas toy drive the club organizes each year. He said the 2008 canned food drive alone kept the Chester Food Pantry stocked for six months.<br><br>
Shirtz said he plans to attend John Hopkins University in Baltimore, Md., in the fall.<br><br>
Asked about the significance of volunteerism, Shirtz said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to give back to anyone that you can if you have the ability. It&rsquo;s really a responsibility.&rdquo;</span><br><br clear="all">
