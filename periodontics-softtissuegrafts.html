<p>Periodontal procedures are available to stop further dental problems and gum

recession, and/or to improve the esthetics of your gum line.



<P>Exposed tooth roots are the result of gum recession. Perhaps you wish to

enhance your smile by covering one or more of these roots that make your teeth

appear too long.  Or, maybe you're not bothered by the appearance of these

areas, but you cringe because the exposed roots are sensitive to hot or cold

foods and liquids.



<P>Your gums may have receded for a variety of reasons, including aggressive tooth

brushing or periodontal disease. You may not be in control of what caused the

recession, but prior to treatment your periodontist can help you identify the

factors contributing to the problem.  Once these contributing factors are

controlled, a soft tissue graft procedure will repair the defect and help to prevent

additional recession and bone loss.

<P>Soft tissue grafts can be used to cover roots or develop gum tissue where absent

due to excessive gingival recession.  During this procedure, your periodontist

takes gum tissue from your palate or another donor source to cover the exposed

root.  This can be done for one tooth or several teeth to even your gum line and

reduce sensitivity.


<p><b>What are the benefits of this procedure?</b></p>


A soft tissue graft can reduce further recession and bone loss.  In some cases, it

can cover exposed roots to protect them from decay.  This may reduce tooth

sensitivity and improve esthetics of your smile.  Whether you have crown

lengthening to improve function or esthetics, patients often receive the benefits of

both: a beautiful new smile and improved periodontal health - your keys to

smiling, eating and speaking with comfort and confidence.
