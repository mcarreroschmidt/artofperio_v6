<p><b>Selecting a toothbrush:</b> Look for a toothbrush that has
the ADA Seal of Acceptance
and soft-bristles. The size and
shape of the brush should fit
your mouth.
<p><b>Step-by-Step:</b> To clean the
outside surfaces of your teeth,
position the brush at a 45-degree
angle where your gums
and teeth meet. Gently move
the brush in a circular motion
several times using short,
gentle strokes. Apply light pressure
to get the bristles between
the teeth. This should not cause
discomfort. Use the same
method on the inside of the back
teeth. Move the brush in short,
gentle but firm strokes, keeping
it angled against the gumline.
<p>To clean the inside surfaces of
the upper and lower front teeth,
hold the brush vertically. Make
several gentle back-and-forth
strokes over each tooth and its
surrounding gum tissue.
<p>To clean the biting surfaces of
your teeth, use short gentle
strokes. Since the toothbrush can
clean only one or two teeth at a
time, change the position of the
brush as often as necessary to
reach and clean all tooth surfaces.
If you have any questions,
ask your periodontist or dental
care provider.
<p><b>Don't forget to floss.</b> There's
no clear answer on whether it's
better to floss first then brush
or brush then floss. Flossing first
may loosen plaque, which can
then be brushed away with your
toothbrush.
<p><b>Don't skip the professional
visits.</b> Professional cleanings at
least twice a year are necessary
to remove calculus from places
your toothbrush and floss may
have missed. And, a professional
evaluation can determine
if you have periodontal diseases.
