<? $Title = "Dental Implants to Replace Missing Teeth" ?>
<? include "includes/template-top.php" ?>

<p>You may be missing one or more teeth as a result of periodontal disease or trauma. Perhaps that adult tooth may never have come in.  You know that your confidence about your teeth affects how you feel about yourself, both personally and professionally. Perhaps you hide your smile because of spaces from missing teeth. Maybe your dentures don't feel secure. Perhaps you have difficulty chewing. If you are missing one or more teeth and would like to smile, speak and eat again with comfort and confidence, there is good news! Dental implants are teeth that can look and feel just like your own! Under proper conditions, such as placement by Dr. Goteiner and diligent patient maintenance, implants can last a lifetime.

<p><b>What Dental Implants Can Do</b>
<ul>
<li>Replace one or more teeth without affecting bordering teeth
<li>Support a bridge and eliminate the need for a removable partial denture
<li>Provide support for a denture, making it more secure and comfortable
</ul>
<p>See us for consultation to see if you are a candidate for implant dentistry. Dr. Goteiner works closely in conjunction with your restorative dentist for the most aesthetic, functional result.

<p><b>Sinus Augmentation</b>
<p>On occasion you may require extra bone to place an implant in the molar area of your upper teeth.  Besides that traditional Caldwell-Luck procedure this office uses the much more conservative and less traumatic Summer’s osteotome technique.  With the Summer’s technique the implant can be placed 4 months after the procedure.

<p><b>Ridge Augmentation and Expansion</b>
<p>This technique is used to add bone to both the upper and lower jaw so that the implant can be properly place.  It also can assist in getting rid of that “sunken look” that often occurs after you have lost teeth.

<p><b>Immediate Load Implants</b>
<p>On occasion we can extract a broken tooth, place the implant and cap (crown) all in the same visit.  In this way the is no need to wear any type of removable appliance while waiting to get your final crown
<p>See us for consultation to see if you are a candidate for an immediately loaded implant.   Dr. Goteiner works closely in conjunction with your restorative dentist for the most aesthetic, functional result.

<p><b>Dental Implants</b>
<p>Dental implants are pure titanium screws (the same material that orthopedic surgeons use) which are gently placed into the bone.  They then are permitted to literally integrate with the bone for 2-3 months on the lower jaw and 3-6 months on the upper jaw.  Once it has stabilized a crown or a bridge can be placed on by your restorative dentist.  This approach eliminates the need to file down the adjacent teeth to or put extra stresses on the adjacent teeth when a fixed or removable bridge is made.
<p>Studies have demonstrated that implant supported crowns and bridges are at least as stable and predictable as conventional fixed bridges.
