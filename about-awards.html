<p>Volunteerism and community participation are important for maintaining a thriving community. This is a lesson that should be learned early by the students in our community.
<p>To encourage students to take a responsible place in their community, Dr. Goteiner and his wife, Carrie, sponsor Community Service awards for a graduating senior from each of West Morris, Mendham, Randolph, Roxbury and Hackettstown high schools. The recipient is someone who gives of him or herself by participating in community service. The award is a $200 savings bond.
<p>The selection criteria are simple:
<ol>
<li>The winner should be a student who does not seek recognition.<p>
<li>The student should demonstrate the highest standards of honesty and reliability.<p>
<li>The student should exemplify the citizen who cares for and contributes to his or her community through action.
</ol>
<p>Schools nominate students from among those recommended by fellow students. The nomination process simply involves filling out a form and mailing it to Dr. Goteiner by April 1 of each year. If a school gives award winners a special certificate, that certificate is completed. Otherwise, Dr. Goteiner provides a certificate.
<p>Over the past few years the Observer Tribune has been writing articles on the recipients. Articles have been posted <a href='generalarticles.asp' style='text-decoration:underline'>HERE</a>.
