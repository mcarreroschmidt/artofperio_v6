<p>Women: Your health care
needs are unique, and re-
quire special care. Taking care of
your health also includes oral
health because it's an important
part of your overall health.
Periodontal researchers
are making strides to find
out how periodontal
diseases may affect
women's overall health.
Recent issues of the
<i>Journal of Periodontology</i>
published findings
that relate to women's
unique oral health needs.
Following is a brief overview
of some of these
studies:
<p><li><b>Menstrual Cycle Affects
Periodontal Health</b> - Researchers
found that many women noticed
an increase in gingival inflammation
and discomfort associated
with their menstrual cycle. This is
the first time this well-known
phenomenon has been studied.
<p>Symptoms included a slight
burning sensation, bleeding with
minor irritation, redness to the
gums, oral ulcers and discomfort
in the gums. Further studies will
be required to examine whether
these symptoms will have lasting
negative effects. In the meantime,
women should tell their dental
professionals about changes taking
place in the
mouth or body.
This includes
taking prescription
or
over-the-counter
medications.
This way the
dental professional
can explain
any effects it may
have on periodontal health.
<p><li><b>Infertility Treatment and Oral
Health</b> - Researchers found that
women undergoing ovulation induction
for infertility treatment for
more than three menstrual cycles
experience higher gingival inflammation,
bleeding and gingival crevicular
fluid. (This fluid contains
enzymes and tissue products that
are potential markers for the progression
of periodontitis.) These
effects are presumably associated
with increased levels of
progesterone and estrogen.
<p>Several studies also provided
evidence that the presence of infection
is associated with unsuccessful
embryo development
and implantation failure in in vitro
fertilization patients.
<p>Since periodontal disease is a
chronic bacterial infection, future
studies may determine the effects
of periodontal status and periodontal
treatment on the outcome of
infertility treatment.
<p><li><b>Pregnancy Complication is
Associated with Periodontal
Destruction</b> - The January 2005
<i>JOP</i> reported that periodontal inflammation
plays a possible role in
the development of preeclampsia,
a potentially deadly condition that
affects approximately five percent
of U.S. pregnancies. Researchers
found that periodontal disease was
more severe in the preeclamptic
patients, which suggests an interaction
between periodontal disease
and pregnancy. In fact, the protein
levels of cytokines in the preeclamptic
group were nearly three
times greater than the healthy
group.
