<p>The American Academy of Periodontology challenges the public to
quit making excuses
for not brushing and
flossing by offering
the following &quot;excuse
busters.&quot; A good athome
oral hygiene routine
will help ensure a
beautiful smile, prevent
periodontal disease -
a major cause of tooth
loss in adults, and
guarantee a lifetime of
smiles.
<p><b>1. My hands are too
big and I have no dexterity.</b>
If dexterity problems are
the excuse, a power floss
holder or automatic tooth brush
may solve this problem.
<p><b>2. Floss pushes food further into
the pocket.</b> Not only does floss
loosen food in between teeth, but
its primary function is to remove
the invisible film of bacteria that
constantly forms between teeth.
Floss cleans about 30 percent of
the tooth's surfaces in places that
the toothbrush cannot always
reach.
<p><b>3. When I floss, my gums bleed.</b>
Floss does not cause your gums to
bleed, but not flossing daily could.
That's because flossing
may help prevent gingivitis,
the mildest form of
periodontal disease.
Gingivitis
causes the
gums to redden,
swell
and bleed
easily.
Gingivitis
is often
caused
by
inadequate
oral hygiene and
can be reversible with
professional treatment
and good oral home care.
<p><b>4. My teeth are cleaned professionally
twice a year, so I don't have to
brush and floss.</b> It's important to
get your teeth cleaned and examined
twice a year, but a daily at-home
oral hygiene routine is equally as
important. When plaque is not removed
daily, it can turn into a hard
substance called calculus/tartar in
less than two days. Daily cleaning
helps minimize calculus formation.
<p><b>5. It takes too long.</b> Thorough
brushing and flossing takes less
time than shaving or applying
make-up.
<p><b>6. Brushing and flossing gets in
the way of family time.</b> Actually
not brushing and flossing can take
away from family time. Research
suggests that periodontal diseases
can pass through saliva, common
contact of saliva through family
time such as kissing may put your
loved ones at an increased risk for
contracting periodontal diseases,
and more trips to the dentist.
<p><b>7. Losing teeth is part of aging
anyway, so brushing and flossing
won't help.</b> The image of grandparents'
teeth in a glass is an image
of yesteryear. More people are
keeping their natural teeth longer
with brushing and flossing.
<p><b>8. My teeth are too tight for the
floss.</b> If you have tight spaces between
your teeth, polymer floss
that's ADA approved may slide in
between your teeth easily.
<p><b>9. I damage my gums when I floss.</b>
If the correct technique is being
used, gums will not be damaged.
Read below for the correct way to
brush and floss. Or, if you prefer,
ask your dental care provider for a
refresher in oral hygiene technique.
