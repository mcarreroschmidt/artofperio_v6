<p>CHESTER &ndash; Graduating seniors from Mendham and West Morris Central high schools were among those recognized for community service by Chester periodontist, Dr. David Goteiner and his wife, Carrie.</p>
<p>The students will receive a certificate of honor and a savings bond as part of the Goteiners&rsquo; annual program.</p>
<p>Honored students included Amanda Brown from Mendham High School and Taylor Billing from West Morris Central High School.</p>
<p>Others included Francis Mancho  from Mount Olive High School; Daniel Cwieka, Hackettstown High School; Joshua Levy, Randolph High School; and Anthony SanFilippo, Roxbury High School.</p>
<p><q>We know there are students out there quietly doing things to make our community a better place to live,</q> Dr. Goteiner said in a statement.  <q>Because they go about it in such a modest way, their work usually goes unnoticed except by those whose lives they touch.</q></p>
<p>Recipients of the Community Service Award are selected based on recommendations from guidance counselors at their schools.</p>
<p>Dr. Goteiner has a private practice in Chester and is a clinical professor of periodontology at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.</p>
