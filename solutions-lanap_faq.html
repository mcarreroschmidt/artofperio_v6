<div><b>What is Periodontal Disease?</b></div>
<div>It&rsquo;s an infection of the gums. It starts out as plaque, an opaque film on the teeth that hardens to form calculus or tartar. As tartar accumulates, it harbors bacteria which attack the soft tissue around the gums. This early stage of gum disease is called Gingivitis. Symptoms include red swollen gums, bleeding, bad breath and, sometimes, an unpleasant taste in the mouth. Untreated, Gingivitis becomes Periodontitis. At this severe stage, bacteria destroy both the gums and the supporting bone structural Pockets form where teeth are separated from the gums and surrounding bones. Left untreated, Periodontitis eventually results in tooth loss.</div><br>

<div><b>What&rsquo;s the best way to treat Periodontal Disease?</b></div>
<div>LANAP<sup>&reg;</sup> surgical laser protocol alternative to gum surgery, is a less painful, less traumatic way to treat periodontal disease at any stage.</div><br>

<div><b>What&rsquo;s different about the Research Proven LANAP<sup>&reg;</sup>?</b></div>
<div>The LANAP<sup>&reg;</sup> Procedure uses a special kind of laser called the PerioLase<sup>&reg;</sup> MVP-7&trade;, invented by two dentists in Cerritos, California. Dr. Robert Gregg and Dr. Delwin McCarthy spent years developing a better way to treat gum disease. The laser fiber, which is only about as wide as three human hairs, is inserted between the gum tissue and your tooth, where it painlessly removes the noxious elements that cause gum disease.</div><br>

<div><b>How many treatments will I need?</b></div>
<div>The LANAP<sup>&reg;</sup> Procedure doesn&rsquo;t take much time at all &mdash; just two two-hour sessions versus eight to ten one-hour sessions with surgery. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about bleeding, stitches or post-treatment infection, because your gums haven&rsquo;t been cut.</div><br>

<div><b>What about recovery &mdash; will I be in pain or need to follow a special routine?</b></div>
<div>The sense of recovery is immediate, due to the laser&rsquo;s ability to seal blood vessels, lymphatics and nerve endings. Of course, your tissue needs time to recover, regenerate and heal over the course of time, but after the LANAP<sup>&reg;</sup> Procedure treatment, you can drive your car, go back to work, or do anything else you like.</div><br>

<div><b>I can see how good the LANAP<sup>&reg;</sup> Procedure is &mdash; but is it very expensive and will my insurance cover it?</b></div>
<div>The good news is, the LANAP<sup>&reg;</sup> Procedure is about the same as conventional surgery. Dental costs vary around the country, so find a PerioLase<sup>&reg;</sup> MVP-7&trade; dentist in your area for exact figures. There is no special code for our therapy, so if your insurance company will reimburse for conventional surgery, they will reimburse for the LANAP<sup>&reg;</sup> Procedure.</div><br>
