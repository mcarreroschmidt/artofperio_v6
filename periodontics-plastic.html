<p>First impressions are everything! So why not make a good first impression when you meet someone, go on a job interview or a first date by dazzling him or her with your "Hollywood smile." Whatever the reason, periodontal plastic procedures can help you "knock the socks off" of anyone by giving you a perfect smile and boosting your confidence so you can be at your best. </p>

<p>Cosmetic surgery has become more popular than ever before especially now that more Americans are living longer and aging more gracefully with the help of plastic surgery. Periodontal plastic surgery has also felt this trend as it has experienced a significant shift toward cosmetic-related surgery to help make smiles last a lifetime. </p>

<p>A recent poll of 253 consumers conducted by the American Academy of Periodontology found the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>50 percent consider the smile the first facial feature they notice
<li>80 percent are not happy with their smile
<li>Respondents were seven times more likely to have periodontal, smile enhancement procedures, than face-lifts
<li>Smile enhancement procedures outnumbered eyelid surgeries five to one
</ul>
<p><b>Gummy Smile or Uneven Gum Line</b><br>
Do you feel your teeth look too short and your smile is too gummy or your gums cover too much of some teeth while leaving the others the right length? If so crown lengthening might be the solution for you. During this procedure, excess gum tissue is removed to expose more of the crown of the tooth. Then your gumline is sculpted to give your new smile just the right look. </p>

<p><b>Long Teeth/Exposed Roots</b><br>
Do you feel you look older than you really are? Sometimes gum recession causes the tooth root to become exposed, which makes your teeth look long and can make you look older than you are. This recession can happen as a result of a variety of causes, including periodontal diseases. Whatever the reason, exposed roots are unappealing and can leave you at risk of developing cavities on your tooth root. </p>

<p>Soft tissue grafts and other root coverage procedures are designed to cover exposed roots, to reduce further gum recession and to protect vulnerable roots from decay. </p>

<p><b>Missing Teeth</b><br>
Are you starting to look like your grandmother because missing teeth are causing unappealing gaps in your smile? If so, dental implants might be the answer for you. </p>

<p>Dental implants are a more natural looking option compared to dentures or bridges because implants look and feel just like your own teeth. They also allow you to speak and eat with comfort and confidence. </p>

<p>During this procedure, an artificial tooth root is placed into your jaw, and after a healing period, an artificial tooth is attached to the root. </p>

<p><b>Indentations in the Gums and Jawbone</b><br>
Tooth loss can cause an indentation in the gums and jawbone where the tooth used to be. This happens because the jawbone recedes when it no longer is holding a tooth in place. Not only is this indention unnatural looking, it also causes the replacement tooth to look too long compared to the adjacent teeth.
Ridge augmentation can fill in this defect recapturing the natural contour of the gums and jaw. A new tooth can then be created that is natural looking, easy to clean and beautiful.</p>

<p><b>Combination Procedures</b><br>
Oftentimes, periodontists may use several different types of procedures to build a framework for your perfect smile. </p>
