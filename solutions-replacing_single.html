<? $Title = "Replacing A Single Tooth" ?>

<p>A dental implant provides several advantages over tooth replacement options.  In addition to looking and function like a natural tooth, a dental implant replaces a single tooth without sacrificing the health of neighboring teeth.  The other common treatment for the loss of a single tooth, a tooth supported fixed bridge, requires that adjacent teeth be ground down to support the cemented bridge.
<p>Because a dental implant will replace your tooth root, the bone is better preserved.  With a bridge, some of the bone that previously surrounded the tooth begins to resorb (deteriorate).  Dental implants integrate with your jawbone, helping to keep the bone healthy and intact.

<p>In the long term, A single implant can be more esthetic and easier to keep clean than a bridge.  Gums can recede around a bridge, leaving a visible defect when the metal base or collar of the bridge becomes exposed.  Resorbed bone beneath the bridge can lead to an unattractive smile.  Another concern is the cement holding the bridge in place can wash out allowing bacteria to decay the teeth that anchor the bridge.
