 23, 2005</span></font><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'> -- <span class=embeddedlink><a
href="http://my.webmd.com/content/article/23/1728_57338.htm" target="_new">Pregnant women
have extra incentive to brush,</a></span> floss, and take good care of their teeth.
Those simple steps could help their babies get a better start in life. </span></font></p>

<p><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Bacteria
in the mouth of the mother-to-be could influence the baby's birth weight and
delivery date, says a new study. That's important because babies born
prematurely and/or at a low birth weight are more vulnerable to health
problems, disability, and even death. </span></font></p>

<p><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
preterm and low birth weight problem was put in sharp, startling detail earlier
this year in a CDC report. The <span class=embeddedlink><a href="http://my.webmd.com/content/Article/99/105338.htm" target="_new">CDC
found that infant deaths rose in 2002 for the first times since 1958,</a></span>
partly due to more babies being born too small and too soon. </span></font></p>

<p><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Birth
weight is one of the most important predictors of an infant's survival
chances,&quot; the CDC reported. The 2002 death rate for preterm infants was 15
times higher than that of full-term babies, according to the CDC. </span></font></p>

<p><strong><b><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial'>Rates Rising</span></font></b></strong><font size=2 face=Arial><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> </span></font></p>

<p><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Today,
most </span></font><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:Arial'>U.S.</span></font><font size=2 face=Arial><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> babies are not born prematurely
(before 37 weeks of pregnancy) or at a low birth weight. Medical advances have
made it possible to keep tiny babies alive that would almost certainly not have
survived in past generations. </span></font></p>

<p><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>But
the problem hasn't gone away. Preterm low birth weight is still the second
leading cause of infant death in general. </span></font></p>

<p><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
numbers have increased in </span></font><font size=2 face=Arial><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>America</span></font><font size=2
face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> over the last few
decades. The preterm delivery rate rose from 10.2% to 11.6% of all live births
from 1987-1998. Low birth weight increased for all races from 6.8% to 7.6% from
1980-2000. </span></font></p>

<p><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Those
numbers come from the latest study on oral health, preterm delivery, and low
birth weight. The researchers included Ananda Dasanayake of </span></font><font
  size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>New York</span></font><font
 size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> </span></font><font
  size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>University</span></font><font
size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>'s </span></font><font
  size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>College</span></font><font
 size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> of </span></font><font
  size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Dentistry</span></font><font
size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>. </span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'><br>
Which Groups Have the Highest Rates of Preterm Delivery?</span></font></p>

<p><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;These
rates are at least two times higher among African Americans,&quot; write
Dasanayake and colleagues. In fact, preterm low birth weight is the major cause
of infant mortality among African-American infants. </span></font></p>

<p><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Overseas,
even more preterm babies die young. Every year, about <span class=embeddedlink><a href="http://my.webmd.com/content/article/101/106366.htm" target="_new">4
million babies die before they're 1 month old.</a></span> Most are born in
poorer countries that often lack sanitation and medical facilities expected in
the West. Preterm birth is a leading cause, accounting for an estimated 28% of
infant deaths worldwide. That's according to a report published in The Lancet
earlier this month. </span></font></p>

<p><strong><b><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial'>Oral Health's Role</span></font></b></strong><font size=2 face=Arial><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> </span></font></p>

<p><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Certainly,
oral health isn't the only reason for preterm delivery or low birth weight. The
mother's overall health, resources, and prenatal care are crucial. </span></font></p>

<p><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Still,
bacteria seen in gum disease and cavities may play a role. The mouth is home to
hundreds of types of bacteria, some of which are linked to dental problems. </span></font></p>

<p><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Recently,
oral bacteria were studied in about 300 pregnant women in </span></font><font
  size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Alabama</span></font><font
size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>. Most of
the women were black and lived in a low-income area in and around </span></font><font
  size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Birmingham</span></font><font
size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>. That
reduced the influence of racial, social, or economic factors, say Dasanayake
and colleagues. </span></font></p>

<p><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
researchers monitored levels of several types of bacteria while the women were
pregnant. They also noted the babies' delivery date and birth weight. </span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'><br>
Helpful, Harmful Bacteria</span></font></p>

<p><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>One
type of bacteria -- <em><i><font face=Arial><span style='font-family:Arial'>Actinomyces
naselundii</span></font></i></em> - was linked to lower birth weight and
earlier delivery. Another bacteria -- <em><i><font face=Arial><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Lactobacillus casei</span></font></i></em> -- was
associated with a slightly higher birth weight and delivery date. </span></font></p>

<p><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Different
kinds of lactobacillus bacteria are found elsewhere in the body. For instance,
they help with digestion. Possibly, the lactobacillus bacteria in the women's
mouths helped keep the vaginal environment healthy, boosting the chances of a
good delivery, says the study. </span></font></p>

<p><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
researchers aren't sure how that works. Possibly, &quot;oral bacteria and the
molecules the body produces against them can enter the uterine environment
through the bloodstream and may influence the delivery process,&quot; says
Dasanayake in a news release. </span></font></p>

<p><span class=embeddedlink><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><a href="http://my.webmd.com/content/article/82/97236.htm" target="_new">Harmful oral bacteria
have also been linked to greater risk of heart disease.</a></span></font></span><font
size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> A similar
theory -- oral bacteria that flow through the blood to other parts of the body
-- has been floated for that problem, too. </span></font></p>

<p><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>That's
all the more reason to reach for your toothbrush. Monitoring oral bacteria
levels could help reduce poor pregnancy outcomes, the researchers conclude. </span></font></p>

<p><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Their
study appears in the Journal of Periodontology's February issue. </span></font></p>
