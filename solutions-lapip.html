<p><b>Implant Complications</b></p>

<p>The last 20 years has seen a revolution in dentistry, especially in the field of Dental Implants .Gone are the days where patients have to suffer with loose fitting dentures, and removable partials that cause damage to adjacent teeth. Dental Implants are here to stay and are overwhelmingly successful when placed and restored by experienced Dentists and Dental Surgeons.</p>

<p>But like anything, despite our best efforts we are seeing more and more complications with implants. This is a condition we call &ldquo;Peri-Implantitis&rdquo;. Many times, implants can get infections under the gum-line which can result in bone loss around the implant, and in some cases loss of the implant itself. Complications due to systemic disease, medications and simply enough, aging can all lead to this problem.</p>

<p>Until recently, the only treatment for an &ldquo;ailing&rdquo; implant was either extensive surgical repair and in most cases, removal of the implant and waiting for a new one to be placed.</p>

<p>With the advent of LAPIP, which is a specific laser surgery procedure which does not involve a scalpel or stitches we are now able in many cases to treat the infections and arrest the disease, and in some cases regenerate new bone around the implant itself!</p>

<p>LAPIP&mdash;which stands for Laser Assisted Peri-Implant Procedure, and like LANAP which is done to treat gum infections around teeth, is the only FDA cleared laser procedure to treat ailing dental implants.</p>

<p>Dr. David Goteiner has been performing these procedures for almost a decade. And, in addition to his private practice, is an instructor at the Institute for Advanced Laser Dentistry, where he trains other dentists and surgeons from around the world so that they too can help their patients conquer this significant disease. Dr. Goteiner is one of only 40 qualified instructors and is the first Periodontist to perform these procedures in the Northern New Jersey area.</p>
