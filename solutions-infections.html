<p>Reducing bone loss that causes a pocket around tooth and eliminating the bacteria associated with this disease are important to prevent further damage and maintain a healthy smile.  Eliminating bacteria alone may not be sufficient to prevent disease recurrence because deep pockets will permit them to return.  Deeper pockets are more difficult for you and your dental care professional to clean, so it's important for you to reduce them. Reduced pockets and a combination of daily oral hygiene and professional maintenance care increases your chances of keeping your natural teeth - and decreases the chance of serious health problems associated with periodontal disease.
<p>There are many approaches to treating the ravages of this infection.  They range from non-surgical therapy to regenerating the bone you have lost.
<p>Don't wait to control your periodontal disease. Dr Goteiner and their caring staff will be happy to meet with you to review your treatment options for a beautiful, functional smile that will last a lifetime.
