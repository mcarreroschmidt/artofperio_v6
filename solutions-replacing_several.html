<? $Title = "Replacing Several Teeth" ?>

<p>Dental implants provide several advantages over other teeth replacement options.  In addition to looking and functioning like natural teeth, implant-supported bridges replace teeth without adjacent natural teeth.  Other common treatments for the loss of several teeth, such as fixed bridges or removable partial dentures, are dependent on support from adjacent teeth.
<p>In addition, because implant-supported bridges will replace some of your tooth roots, your bone is better preserved.  With a fixed bridge or removable partial denture, the bone that surrounded the tooth root may begin to resorb (deteriorate).  Dental implants integrate with your jawbone, helping to keep the bone healthy and intact.
<p>In the long term, implants are esthetic, functional and comfortable.  Gums and bone can recede around a fixed bridge or removable partial denture, leaving a visible defect.  Resorbed bone beneath bridges or removable partial denture can lead to a collapsed, unattractive smile.  Another concern is the cement holding the bridge in place can wash out allowing bacteria to decay the teeth that anchor the bridge.  In addition, removable partial dentures can move around in the mouth and reduce your ability to eat certain foods.
