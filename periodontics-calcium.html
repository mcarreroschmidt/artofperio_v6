<p>Adults consuming at least three
servings of calcium each day
have a reason to smile. A study
in the <i>Journal of Periodontology</i>
found that people who get enough
calcium have significantly lower
rates of periodontal disease, a
leading cause of tooth loss.
That's because periodontal disease
isn't only about gum tissue.
The tooth's health depends upon
the integrity of the bone holding
the tooth in place.
<p>Researchers found that people
who intake less than 500 milligrams
of calcium, or about half
the recommended dietary allowance,
were almost twice as likely
to have periodontal disease, as
measured by the loss of attachment
of the gums from the teeth.
<p>The association was particularly
evident for people in their 20s
and 30s. The relationship between
calcium and periodontal
disease is likely due to calcium's
role in building density in the
bone that supports the teeth.
<p>Calcium alone can't prevent or
cure periodontal disease, but it's
an important part of an overall
prevention or treatment program.
Unfortunately, national surveys
have shown that many Americans
are not consuming enough
calcium, and many women
consume less than half of the
recommended daily amount of
calcium. According to the National
Osteoporosis Foundation, women
have less bone tissue and lose it
more rapidly than men because
of the changes involved in
menopause.
<p>It's important for women to eat
calcium-rich foods and to speak
to their healthcare providers
about obtaining the proper
amount of calcium. This way you
can take an active role in
helping your smile last a lifetime.
