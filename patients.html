<p><b>Thank you for visiting our web site and for your interest in learning more about OralDNA<sup>&reg;</sup> Labs!</b></h3>
<p>As you may be aware, the past 10 years have provided much insight into what has come to be called... <q>The Oral / Systemic Connection</q>. There does appear to be a link to chronic inflammatory periodontal infections and systemic diseases such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Heart disease</li>
	<li>Diabetes</li>
	<li>Stroke</li>
	<li>Some forms of cancer and other diseases</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Goteiner has carried out studies at Morristown Memorial Hospital. You can see results here:</p>

	<li><a target="_new" href="/pdf/Heart_Attacks.pdf">Study at Morristown Hospital</a> (PDF)</li>

</ul>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) and other research facilities are aggressively pursuing this link as well. For More information regarding the Oral/Systemic Connection, visit the following links online:</p>

<p>As we continue to learn more about the severity of periodontal infections and how closely linked they are to your overall health, having detailed information about your genetic susceptibility (MyPerioID<sup>&reg;</sup> PST<sup>&reg;</sup>) and the bacteria that are present in our mouth (MyPerioPath<sup>&reg;</sup>) will be critical in determining your oral and overall general health.</p>
<h4>Introducing <b>MyPerioPath<sup>&reg;</sup></b>:</h4>
<p>This test indentifies and measures certain bacteria in your mouth that cause gingivitis (early stage gum disease) and periodontal disease (mature gum disease).</p>
<h4>Introducing <b>MyPerioID<sup>&reg;</sup> PST<sup>&reg;</sup></b>:</h4>
<p>This test determines if you are more likely to develop more serious gum tissue infections, such as inflammatory periodontal disease.</p>
<h4>Introducing <b>OraRisk&#8480; HPV</b>:</h4>
<p>This test determines if you are at increased risk for HPV-related oral and throat cancers.</p>
<p>These new, quick, and non-invasive tests deliver information that will enable your dental professional to better determine the appropriate treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.</p>
