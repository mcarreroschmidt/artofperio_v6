<p>Snoring and sleep apnea is a serious problem for millions.  It is linked to high blood pressure, strokes and even cardiac arrest.  Snoring can also be disruptive to personal and family life.
<p>If you find that surgical procedures or CPAP is not improving the quality of a night's sleep.  With a referral from your physician, Dr. Goteiner will be glad to review, recommend, and fabricate an appliance that will help you get a good night&rsquo;s sleep.
