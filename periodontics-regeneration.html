<p>Your bone and gum tissue should fit snugly around your teeth like a turtleneck

around your neck.  When you have periodontal disease, this supporting tissue

and bone is destroyed and pockets develop.  Eventually, if too much bone is lost,

the teeth will need to be extracted.



<P>Your periodontist may recommend a regenerative procedure when the bone

supporting your teeth has been destroyed.  These procedures can reverse some

of the damage by regenerating lost bone and tissue.



<P>During this procedure, your periodontist folds back the gum tissue and removes

the disease-causing bacteria.  Membranes (filters), bone grafts or tissue-stimulating proteins can be used to encourage your body's natural ability to

regenerate bone and tissue.



<P>There are many options to enhance support for your teeth and to restore your

bone to a healthy level. Your periodontist will discuss your best options with you.

<p><b>What are the benefits of this procedure?</b></p>
Eliminating existing bacteria and regenerating bone and tissue helps to reduce

pocket depth and repair damage caused by the progression of periodontal

disease.  With a combination of daily oral hygiene and professional maintenance

care, you'll increase the chances of keeping your natural teeth - and decrease

the chances of serious health problems associated with periodontal disease.
