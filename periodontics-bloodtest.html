<p>In a recent study reported in the
<i>Journal of Periodontology (JOP)</i>,
researchers found that a routine
medical blood test may also reveal
indicators of periodontal diseases.
<p>Researchers examined and
measured the oral health of 7,452
men and women, and tested
their blood for 37 items used in
general blood tests. Some of the
items tested for in the blood include
cholesterol and C-reactive
protein, commonly linked to heart
disease; and diabetes. The results
of the blood tests were compared
against the oral health
scores of participants.
<p>The study found that generally
if the blood was &quot;healthy,&quot; the oral
health was also healthy, and if
the blood test detected certain
&quot;red flags,&quot; serious symptoms of
periodontal disease were
present. Men were reported to
have more serious symptoms of
periodontal diseases than females.
The only item from the
blood test that showed a significant
relationship with periodontal
disease in women was CRP.
<p>Although a specific reason could
not be pinpointed, one reason
could be that men and women
have different endocrine situations,
and periodontal diseases are influenced
by endocrine conditions.
<p>In the future when patients visit
their medical doctors for routine
exams and annual blood work is
drawn, they may also be referred
to a periodontist for a periodontal
screening if the blood indicates
systemic abnormalities.
