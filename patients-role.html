<p>The most important factor in obtaining and maintaining a successful result is your cooperation.
<p>There is no quick cure for periodontal disease. Successful treatment depends on meticulous care on the part of your periodontist, your referring dentist and, most of all, you. We'll be showing you new ways to take care of your mouth. Following these directions is as important as the care provided by Dr. Goteiner and his staff.
<p>Successful treatment is the result of an equal effort from all of us and results may enable you to keep your own teeth in a healthy condition; an extremely gratifying reward for the relatively minor demands on your time and finances.
