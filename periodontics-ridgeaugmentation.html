<p>Sometimes when you lose one or more teeth, you can get an indention in your

gums and jawbone where the tooth used to be.  This happens because the

jawbone recedes when it no longer is holding a tooth in place.



<P>Not only is this indentation unnatural looking, it also causes the replacement

tooth to look too long compared to the adjacent teeth.



<P>A periodontist can fill in this "defect" with a procedure called ridge augmentation,

recapturing the natural contour of your gums and jaw.  A new tooth can then be

created that is natural looking, easy-to-clean and beautiful.
