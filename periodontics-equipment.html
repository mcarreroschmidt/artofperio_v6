<p>Do you know what car oil
and toothbrushes have in
common? Both are designed to
clean away dirt and contaminants,
should be replaced every three
months or sooner, and both become
ineffective when deterioration
sets in. You know when it's
time to change your car oil, but do
you know when it's time to replace
your toothbrush?
<p>Look at the toothbrush.
Are the bristles
bent or frayed? When
was it last replaced?
The American Dental
Association (ADA)
says that toothbrushes
should be replaced every
3-4 months, or sooner.
When bristles become
worn-out, they lose their
effectiveness.
<p>In a study published in
the <i>Journal of Clinical Dentistry</i>,
people were given new and artificially
used toothbrushes (these
brushes were worn down by a machine
to simulate three months of
use). The new toothbrushes removed
significantly more plaque
and gingivitis - the earliest stage
of gum disease, than the worn
brushes.
<p>In addition to the wear and tear
your toothbrush goes through
everyday; overtime it also can become
contaminated with bacteria,
blood, saliva and toothpaste. Although
the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) is
unaware of any adverse health effects
directly related to toothbrush
use, a recommendation is to rinse
the toothbrush thoroughly with
water following brushing and to tap
off excess water. You may
also want to consider
the following to protect
your toothbrush from
bacteria.
<p><b>Do:</b>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands
before and after
brushing.<p>
<li>Allow the brush to
air-dry after each use. The bacteria
most harmful will die when exposed
to oxygen.<p>
<li>Store the toothbrush in an upright
position, so water drains from
it and it dries faster.<p>
<li>Replace it every 3-4 months or
sooner if the bristles appear worn
or you've had a cold or flu to prevent
possible reinfection.<p>
<li>Clean the cover or container often
to kill potentially harmful bacteria
that could cause periodontal
diseases, a serious bacterial infection
that destroys the attachment
fibers and supporting bone that
holds teeth in the mouth.
</ul>
<p><b>Do not:</b>
<ul>
<li>Share your toothbrush. According
to the CDC, the exchange of
body fluids from sharing toothbrushes
could increase the risk for
infections.<p>
<li>Re-use or share the same disinfecting
solutions or mouthwashes
to disinfect your toothbrushes.
This may lead to cross-contamination.<p>
<li>Routinely cover toothbrushes or
store in closed containers. This creates
a humid environment that is
more susceptible to bacterial
growth.<p>
<li>Use a community toothbrush
holder. If you must, clean it often,
and make sure the bristles do not
touch one another.<p>
<li>Touch the toothpaste tube to
your toothbrush.
</ul>
