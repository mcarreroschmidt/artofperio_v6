<p>Dental implants provide several advantages over other teeth replacement options.  In addition to looking and functioning like natural teeth, implant supported full bridges or dentures are designed to be long lasting.  Implant-supported full bridges also are more comfortable and stable than conventional dentures, allowing you to retain a more natural biting and chewing capacity.
<p>In addition, because implant supported full bridged and dentures will replace some of your tooth roots your bone is better preserved.  With conventional dentures, the bone that previously surrounded the tooth roots begins to resorb (deteriorate).  Dental implants integrate with your jawbone, helping to keep the bone healthy and intact.
<p>In the long term, implants can be more esthetic and easier to maintain than conventional dentures.  The loss of bone that accompanies conventional dentures leads to recession of the jawbone and a collapsed, unattractive smile.  Conventional dentures make it difficult to eat certain foods.
<p>See us for consultation to see if you are a candidate for implant dentistry. Dr. Goteiner works closely in conjunction with your restorative dentist for the most aesthetic, functional result.
