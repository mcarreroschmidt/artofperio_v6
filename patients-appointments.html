<p>We know your time is valuable. It is our policy to see patients at their appointed time. However, delays can be caused by emergencies. In this event, we will do our best to advise you of any changes.

<p>Please remember your appointment time is reserved ONLY for you. We request 48 hours notice if you cannot keep an appointment. This courtesy enables us to make it possible to give the time reserved for you to another patient who is anxious for treatment. If we don't receive notice and are unable to reassign the time, we reserve the right to charge for that time.
