<p>Are there risks associated with dental implants?</p>
<p>While uncommon, complications can occur during and after surgery. Some complications include, but are not limited to, infection, blood clots, implant breakage, nerve injury, failure to integrate and loss of integration, any of which can require additional surgery. Although dental implant surgery is extremely successful in most cases, some patients still experience pain. Factors such as a patient&rsquo;s post-surgery activities can affect the longevity of the dental implant. Be sure to discuss these and other risks with your dentist.</p>
